Plots and data realated to assessment of effect of W-S rewiring  & vaccination on network – abbreviations for networks metrics:

 (before vaccination)

* `N_comm`: number of communities
* `modul`: modularity

 (after vaccination)  
* `n_cc_vacc`:   number of connected components
* `gcc_vacc_fract`: fraction of giant (largest) connected component (gcc)
* `N_comm_gcc_vacc`: number of communities in gcc
* `modul_gcc_vacc`: modularity of gcc
* `esti_uppb_epi`: estimated uppser bound of outbreak size ($<F>$ – see paper)
* `log_10_rew_prob`: log10 of rewiring probability
